# Chapter 9 — Pulumi's escape hatch, and the multi-cluster race

## No prefab kit for this house

Most of what Pulumi does day to day is order from a catalog: "one AWS EC2
instance, please," and a plugin built by AWS's own ecosystem knows
exactly how to build it, check on it, and tear it down cleanly. That
catalog has no listing for "one Kind cluster," because Kind isn't a cloud
provider — it's a CLI tool that runs Docker containers on your own
machine and makes them pretend to be Kubernetes nodes. There's no
manufacturer standing behind a prefab "Kind cluster" resource type.

[`modules/cluster.py`](https://github.com/phrankson/platform-core/blob/main/modules/cluster.py)
handles this the way a crew handles a house with no prefab kit available:
build it on-site, from scratch, with general-purpose tools. Pulumi's
version of "general-purpose tools" is `pulumi_command.local.Command` —
the same escape hatch Chapter 8 used for the Docker network, here doing
the much bigger job of standing up the cluster itself. It lets an
arbitrary shell command behave like a real, trackable resource, with a
real create/delete lifecycle:

```python
create = local.Command(
    "kind:create",
    create=create_cmd,                              # kind create cluster ...
    delete=f"kind delete cluster --name {cfg.name}", # runs on `pulumi destroy`
    triggers=replace_triggers or [],
    opts=create_opts,
)
```

Confirming this resource is real, not just described in source, on the
currently selected stack:

```console
$ pulumi stack export --stack platform-sandbox | grep -A2 '"urn".*kind:create'
"urn": "urn:pulumi:platform-sandbox::platform-core::command:local:Command::kind:create",
"custom": true,
"id": "kind:create2f8cb77d",
```

`triggers` exists because Pulumi has no built-in way to know whether an
*arbitrary shell command's* underlying reality changed — it's not a typed
resource whose shape Pulumi understands. For a prefab AWS instance,
Pulumi can compare every field itself. For "run this shell command,"
someone has to say explicitly: rebuild the foundation if any of these
things changed — the rendered network diagram, the Docker network name,
the node image. Without `triggers`, Pulumi would consider the house
"already built" forever, even after a change that should have meant
tearing it down and starting over.

Once the foundation is poured, a second command asks Kind for the
kubeconfig — the credentials needed to actually talk to this specific
house — and a `pulumi_kubernetes.Provider` gets built from it, becoming
the one connection every later step in this repo goes through.

## Two crews, one shared power line

Building three houses at once is fine, as long as they're not all
drawing from the same temporary generator at the same moment. This
project runs all three Kind clusters simultaneously, each supposedly on
its own isolated Docker network — but "isolated" turned out to have a
real limit during actual construction.

<details>
<summary><strong>Predict before reading on:</strong> Kind's multi-cluster networking uses an experimental flag (<code>KIND_EXPERIMENTAL_DOCKER_NETWORK</code>) under the hood. What goes wrong if you try to build a new house while another one, using that same experimental mechanism, is still mid-construction?</summary>

This happened for real while building `app-prod`: creating a new Kind
cluster while another cluster (also mid-bootstrap on
`KIND_EXPERIMENTAL_DOCKER_NETWORK`) was still finishing caused the new
cluster's `kubeadm join` step to fail outright — worker nodes couldn't
find their own control plane, with errors like
`nodes "X-worker" not found`. The experimental flag isn't fully safe for
concurrent multi-cluster bootstraps; the tooling briefly trips over its
own feet, the same way two crews sharing one generator can brown out the
whole site if both fire up power tools at the same instant.

The workaround, confirmed by testing it directly: pause the other
houses' containers while a new one is under construction, then resume
them once it's done.

```console
$ docker pause app-dev-control-plane app-dev-worker app-prod-control-plane app-prod-worker
$ pulumi up --yes   # builds platform-sandbox cleanly, uncontended
$ docker unpause app-dev-control-plane app-dev-worker app-prod-control-plane app-prod-worker
```

This is a real, still-open limitation of building multiple Kind clusters
this way on one machine — not something this codebase fully solves, just
something to know before running `pulumi up` on a house that doesn't
exist yet while the others are actively running.

## When the paperwork doesn't match the building anymore

A smaller, real incident: after one house got stuck mid-construction from
a `docker stop`/`docker start` cycle, it was rebuilt manually with
`kind delete cluster` and `kind create cluster` — bypassing Pulumi
entirely, the way a crew might rebuild a wall without telling the permit
office. That left Pulumi's own records (its stored kubeconfig) pointing
at certificates for a house that, from the paperwork's point of view, no
longer existed in the state it remembered.

The fix is a genuinely reusable Pulumi technique:

```console
$ pulumi up --yes --target-replace 'urn:pulumi:...:kind:kubeconfig' --target-dependents
```

`--target-replace` forces one specific resource to be torn down and
rebuilt — fetch a fresh kubeconfig, this time for real. `--target-dependents`
tells Pulumi to also refresh everything built *from* that resource —
here, the Kubernetes connection built from the kubeconfig. Skip
`--target-dependents` and you'd end up with fresh paperwork sitting next
to a connection still wired to the old, wrong version of it — exactly the
kind of gap Chapter 8 already showed can sit invisible until someone
checks by hand.
